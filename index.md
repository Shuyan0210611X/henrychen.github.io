## About Me

<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">
I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the Business School of the University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on political economy, examining judicial decisions, news markets, economic reforms, and political crises. I have also developed a line of research on expectation formation and attention allocation. My methodological approach is driven by the research question, employing a variety of tools as needed, including causal inference, economic modeling, and machine learning.<br><br>

My work has been published in the <em>Review of Economic Studies</em>, <em>American Political Science Review</em>, <em>American Economic Journal</em>, <em>Economic Journal</em>, <em>International Economic Review</em>, and <em>Journal of Economic Theory</em>. Prior to joining the University of Hong Kong, I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Zurich.

  On the occasion of the New Year of 2026, I had the pleasure of delivering a 30‑minute keynote address to an audience of more than 500 entrepreneurs. 
  The conference brought together business leaders and startup founders to reflect on the turbulence of the past year and to share perspectives on navigating the year ahead.

  My talk, titled <em>“Staying Optimistic Amid Uncertainty,”</em> explored how to find direction and resilience in a business world marked by global unpredictability.
