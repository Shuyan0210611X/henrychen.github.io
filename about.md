## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/image/hengchen.jpeg">

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the business school of the University of Hong Kong. My main research interests comprise two overlapping themes: political economy and information friction. My previous work on collective actions is at the intersection of these two areas, particularly focusing on the role of information transmission in economic and political crises. In my current research, I have explored a variety of subjects within the realm of political economy. I have also developed a line of studies on expectation formation and attention allocation. Prior to moving to Hong Kong, I obtained my PhD in economics from the University of Zurich.
