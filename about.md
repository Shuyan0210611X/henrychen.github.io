## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/image/hengchen.jpeg">

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the Business School of the University of Hong Kong. My current research focuses on political economy, where I have explored numerous crucial issues including judicial decisions, news markets, economic reforms, and political crises. I have also developed a line of research on expectation formation and attention allocation. Prior to joining Hong Kong, I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Zurich.
