## About Me

<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">
I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the Business School of the University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on political economy, examining judicial decisions, news markets, economic reforms, and political crises. I have also developed a line of research on expectation formation and attention allocation. My methodological approach is driven by the research question, employing a variety of tools as needed, including causal inference, economic modeling, structural estimation, and machine learning.<br><br>

My work has been published in the <em>Review of Economic Studies</em>, <em>American Political Science Review</em>, <em>American Economic Journal</em>, <em>Economic Journal</em>, <em>International Economic Review</em>, and <em>Journal of Economic Theory</em>. Prior to joining the University of Hong Kong, I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Zurich.
