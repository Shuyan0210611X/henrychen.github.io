## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/image/hengchen.jpeg">

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the business school of the University of Hong Kong. My main research interests are political economy and information friction. My previous work on collective actions is at the intersection of these two areas, particularly focusing on the role of learning in economic and political crises. In my research, I have explored a variety of subjects within the realm of political economy, such as judicial decision-making and news markets. I have also developed a line of studies on expectation formation and attention allocation. Before moving to Hong Kong, I obtained my PhD in economics from the University of Zurich.
